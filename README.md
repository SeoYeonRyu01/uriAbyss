uriAbyss (Minecraft 1.8-1.16)

uriAbyss is a Minecraft plugin that periodically removes items from the ground and stores them in an "abyss" where players can retrieve them using a command. 
The plugin sorts high-value items like diamond armor, golden apples, and certain blocks, making them accessible later for players.

Features:

  Periodically removes dropped items based on an interval set in the configuration.
  Players can retrieve stored items by using /Abyss.
  Automatically sorts and stores valuable items, such as:
      Diamond armor
      Golden apples
      Specific blocks (e.g., obsidian, sand, diamond blocks, gold blocks).
  Admins can trigger an immediate cleanup and countdown to Abyss opening with /Abyssadm.

Commands:

    /Abyss - Allows players to access the Abyss and retrieve stored items.
    /Abyssadm - Allows administrators to immediately clear items from the ground and start the countdown to Abyss opening.
